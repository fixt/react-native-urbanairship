# react-native-urbanairship
***Urban Airship Integration for React Native***

This module provides limited push notification support for Urban Airship. Eventually it may expand to other UA services. The goal of this is to provide an easy to use React Native interface with Urban Airship and condense the amount of steps it takes to get up and running with it when using React Native.

Please note, this is a work in progress. Setup instructions will be posted soon.
